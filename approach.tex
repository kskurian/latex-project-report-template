\section{Approach}
\subsection{Version 1}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[] \textbf{Ist Phase : } Preprocessing \\ Creating signature using linked list and cross comparison over set of sequence of system calls.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item[] Input : A finite set of applications and various inputs to the application.
                \item[] Output : Set of signatures uniquely identifying the applications in the system.
            \end{itemize}
        \item[] \textbf{IInd Phase : } Processing \\ Detecting malware by comparisons of set of signature and input sequence of system calls.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item[] Input : A random application.
                \item[] Output : Checking for malware for given application.
            \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

The signature created is linear and did not capture complete information.

\subsection{Version 2}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[] {New signature design:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[*] A backbone sequence is created by finding the common sequence of system calls in the input dataset.
            \item[*] Rest of the elements are added to the signature in the form of pairs as per their occurrences in the input sequence after processing.
            \item[*] Unique list of system calls to identify those system calls that are never used. \\ \\
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[] {Advantage}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[*] Showed that an application does have a finitely large backbone which would be present in any run of the application.
            \item[*] Signature database requires less space.
            \item[*] Signature is always linear.
        \end{itemize}
    \item[] {Disadvantage}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[*] Signature followed the smallest input sequence of system calls.
            \item[*] Signature converged and became inadequate as it was too small.
            \item[*] The signature did not consider the system calls that are rejected while cross comparing if it didn't exist in either of them.
            \item[*] Huge chances of false positive and hence the need to modify the preliminary checks. \\
        \end{itemize}
    \item[] {Possible Improvements :}
        \begin{itemize}                                        
            \item[] Signature must capture all the information of the
                application during the learning phase. The system needs to incorporate
                a feedback system so as to improve the signature and to eliminate
                any eror occured during the learning phase. System calls like mutex, poll and futex are repeated many times and hence were not considered during signature creation.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Hence an improvised version of the IDS has been designed inculcating the
advantages and eliminating the disadvantages from previous versions to the
maximum extent possible. The IDS has been proposed keeping in mind the
possible improvements.
